\begin{abstract}
NASA recently announced the Habitable Worlds Observatory (\HWO), a coronagraphic space mission to detect rocky planets in habitable zones, establish their habitability, and search them for biosignatures. 
%
Surface liquid water is central to the definition of planetary habitability.
%
Photometric and polarimetric phase curves of starlight reflected by an exoplanet can reveal ocean glint, rainbows and other phenomena caused by scattering by clouds or atmospheric gas.
%
Direct imaging missions are optimised for planets near quadrature, but \HWO' coronagraph may obscure the phase angles where such optical features are strongest. 
%
The range of accessible phase angles for a given exoplanet will depend on the planet's orbital inclination and/or the coronagraph's inner working angle (IWA). 
%
For planets in near edge-on orbits, accessible phase angles are limited by coronagraphic obscuration. 
%
We use \HWO'~catalogue of 164 target stars to estimate the number of exo-Earths that could be searched for ocean glint, rainbows, and Rayleigh scattering. 
%
We find that most exo-Earths planetary systems in this catalogue will be observable at phase angles at which the Rayleigh scattering peak occurs in their polarimetric phase curve. 
%
The rainbow due to water clouds at phase angles of $\sim\qtyrange{20}{60}{\degree}$ would be observable with \HWO in $\sim\num{46}$ systems, while the ocean glint signature at phase angles of $\sim\qtyrange{130}{170}{\degree}$ would be observable in $\sim\num{16}$ systems, assuming an \IWA of \qty{62}{\mas} ($3\,\lambda/D$ for a $D=\qty{6}{\meter}$ telescope at $\lambda=\qty{600}{\nano\meter}$).
%
Improving the \IWA to $2\,\lambda/D$ increases the number of systems with observable rainbows and glints by factors of approximately 2 and 3, respectively.
%
The number of systems in which an exo-Earth could be searched for these scattering phenomena increases slightly for eccentric orbits.
%
By observing these scattering features, \HWO could detect a surface ocean and water cycle, key indicators of habitability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Liquid surface water is closely related to planetary habitability because it is essential for life as we know it.
%
To first order, its presence can be predicted by the flux a planet receives from its star.
%
The habitable zone (HZ) is defined as the range of semi-major axes around a given main sequence star, for which a rocky planet may have the right temperature to maintain liquid surface water \citep{kasting93}. 
%
However, there are many factors besides the incident stellar flux that influence a planet's ability to hold liquid surface water, such as the atmospheric pressure and geological activity. 
%
Detecting liquid surface water on an exoplanet would thus provide important context for the interpretation of possible biosignatures.
%
Variations of the flux and degree of polarization as an exoplanet orbits its host star---phase variations---could reveal scattering phenomena from condensed water \citep[e.g., rainbows;][]{bailey2007} or specular reflection (i.e., glint) from water oceans \citep[][]{2008Icar..195..927W}.
%
However, depending on a planetary system's architecture, such features can be obscured by the inner working angle (\IWA) of a telescope's coronagraph, shown schematically in \cref{fig:annotated-orbit}.
%
In this paper, we quantify the planetary phase angles that would be accessible for direct observations of hypothetical terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of \HWO target stars.

\subsection{Angle conventions}

As shown in \cref{fig:annotated-orbit}, we define the \emph{scattering angle} $\varphi$ as the planet--star--observer angle (large angles for back-scattering, small angles for forward-scattering) and the supplementary \emph{phase angle} $\alpha$ (\qty{0}{\degree} at full phase and \qty{180}{\degree} at new phase). 
%
A planet on a perfectly face-on orbit is always seen at quadrature, $\varphi = \alpha = \qty{90}{\degree}$, while a planet on an inclined orbit will exhibit a wider range of viewing angles; only perfectly edge-on orbits pass through all possible scattering angles. 
%
In some plots, we report \emph{degrees from quadrature}, so that both new and full phase are at \qty{90}{\degree} for edge-on orbits.

\subsection{Ocean glint}

Ocean glint is the specular (Fresnel) reflection of light off a smooth liquid surface. 
%
While glint is a familiar phenomenon on Earth, there is only one other body in the Solar System where it has been observed: the Cassini orbiter captured the glint of sunlight reflecting off the liquid hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's North Pole as it was observing Titan at crescent phases \citep{2010GeoRL..37.7104S}.
%
In the total flux, the glint signal is indeed expected to be most prominent at large planetary phase angles.
%
The maximum degree of polarization of the glint occurs at the Brewster angle, which is determined by the refractive indices at the interface; between air and liquid water this occurs at a reflection angle of \qty{53}{\degree} locally on the surface \citep[at a planetary phase angle of about \qty{106}%\qty{150}
{\degree}; see, e.g.,][]{Zugger_2010,treesandstam2019}.%{2008Icar..195..927W,Zugger_2010,treesandstam2019}
%
This angle therefore varies slightly with the wavelength and the composition of the ocean and the atmosphere.
%
The angular width of the glint in total and polarized flux generally broadens with increasing wave height \citep{2008Icar..195..927W, kopparla2018, treesandstam2019, trees2022}.
In general, the glint on a planet will be strongest at red wavelengths because there, Rayleigh scattering and attenuation in the atmosphere are smallest \citep{Zugger_2011}. 
%
This has been observed in Earthshine measurements \citep{Emde2017,sterzik2019, takahashi2021}. 
%
At large phase angles, the forward scattering of light by cloud particles could be confused with glint \citep{Robinson_2010}.
%
This confusion can be resolved by measuring polarized phase curves at multiple wavelengths \citep{treesandstam2019}, as shown in \cref{fig:bottplot}, or by probing 
the rainbow, see below.

Glint provides evidence of specular reflecting surfaces, which, taken in the context of the temperature and types of condensates, may be interpreted as evidence for liquid water.
%
The presence of liquid water on the surface of a planet implies the presence of a water cycle, which provides key context to its habitability and the interpretation of atmospheric biosignatures.
%
Aside from detecting ocean glint, the presence of surface water on Earth-like exoplanets can be established through less direct methods near quadrature such as spectropolarimetry, to infer ocean reflection \citep{trees2022}, or through rotational mapping, to identify bright continents and dark oceans \citep[e.g.,][]{2009ApJ...700..915C,lustig2019}.

\subsection{Rainbows, cloudbows, and glories}

Rainbows, cloudbows, glories and other scattering phenomena can dramatically influence the shape of a planet's photometric and polarimetric phase curves and provide a wealth of information about exoplanets \citep{karalidi2012rainbow, stam2008,bailey2007,2014A&A...566L...1G}.%
\footnote{
    Rainbows occur when light is scattered by rain droplets that are large compared to the wavelength of the light. 
    Cloudbows refer to features occurring at the same phase angles from smaller cloud particles, with the spread in colours invisible to the human eye making them appear white \citep[for further discussion, see][]{bailey2007}.  
}
%
In the Solar System, the polarized back-scatter from Titan indicated that the moon's reflection was due to an atmospheric haze rather than a surface \citep{zellner1973polarization}, Venus's polarized phase curve at three wavelengths showed that the clouds were $\sim\qty{75}{\percent}$ H\textsubscript{2}SO\textsubscript{4}--water mixture and constrained the droplet size distribution \citep{hansenhovenier1974}.
%
The glory feature in Venus's flux phase curve was later used to rule out various species as the unknown UV absorber \citep{petrova2018glory}.
%
Glories and rainbows are technically visible both in total and polarized flux phase curves in the presence of spherical cloud and/or haze particles, but their strongly polarized nature coupled with the suppression of other polarized features at gibbous and full phases make them more easily characterized with polarimetry than with photometry \citep{karalidi2011, stam2008, treesandstam2019,trees2022}.
\looseness=-1
%

The phase angles and wavelength dependence of these features are sensitive to the chemical composition and droplet size distribution of condensates in the atmosphere. 
%
As with ocean glint, the detection of liquid condensates on an exoplanet can provide key context to their habitability, potential water cycle, and interpretation of atmospheric biosignatures.
%
In this paper, we define our optimal angle for the detection of a rainbow as that of the peak of the water droplet rainbow at visible wavelengths, which is around a phase angle $\alpha$ of \qty{40}{\degree} (see \cref{fig:bottplot}).
%
Pushing observations to angles closer to the star (smaller and larger phase angles) would allow the determination of the full shape of the rainbow, and enable the identification of rainbows due to the scattering of light by other condensates.
%
The glory can allow further characterization of condensates as its angle and shape also depend on the refractive index, but this glory occurs within a phase angle of \qty{20}{\degree}, when the on-sky separation is small, as can also be seen in \cref{fig:bottplot}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Habitable Worlds Observatory}

The National Academy of Sciences Astronomy \& Astrophysics 2020 Decadal Survey \citep[Astro2020;][]{decadal} recommended a telescope with the capability to detect signatures of habitability on approximately 25 HZ planets in a new \enquote{Great Observatories} program.
%
This requires an instrument with a coronagraph capable of high-contrast imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy at optical to near-infrared wavelengths. 
%
The precursor technology recommended by the survey lists \enquote{direct imaging to probe polarized ocean glint on terrestrial planets} as a priority capability \citep[Box E.1 in][]{decadal} for ground and space-based observatories.
%
Following the release of this report, NASA recently announced the start of the development of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
%
The performance and characteristics (e.g. on- or off-axis, diameter, type of segmentation, polarimetry or photometry, and coronagraph, \IWA) of \HWO will significantly impact the expected exo-Earth yield \citep{Stark2019_exoplanetyield} and are still to be determined.
%
They will likely be heavily informed by the LUVOIR \citep{LUVOIR2019} and HabEx \citep{HabEx_2020} preparatory studies.
%
For generality, in this work, we report angular separations in milliarcseconds; however, for ease of comparison, \cref{tab:IWA_OWA} lists the angular separations corresponding to multiples of $\lambda / D$ for a $\qty{6}{\meter}$ telescope, as suggested in Astro2020, at representative wavelengths $\lambda$ of $\qty{600}{\nano\meter}$ and $\qty{1}{\micro\meter}$.

% \subsection{Outline}

% In this paper, we quantify the planetary phase angles that would be accessible for direct observations of hypothetical terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones of \HWO target stars.
%
% In \cref{subsec:2.1}, we describe the target list, in \cref{subsec:2.2}, we derive expressions for the range of phase angles given a few different limits, in \cref{subsec:2.3}, we describe Monte Carlo simulations to marginalize over the unknown orbital inclination and eccentricity of planets around these stars, and in \cref{subsec:2.4}, we outline how the photometric and polarimetric planet/star contrast changes along a planet's orbit.  
%
% We present and discuss our results in \cref{sec:3}, and conclude in \cref{sec:4}. 
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Target list}
\label{subsec:2.1}

A preliminary target list of nearby stars (maximum distance \qty{25}{\parsec}) around which \HWO may search for habitable rocky planets, assuming a \qty{6}{\meter} telescope, has been compiled: the \emph{NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's Mission Star List for the Habitable Worlds Observatory}.%
\footnote{Available online: \url{https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/internal_resources/2645_NASA_ExEP_Target_List_HWO_Documentation_2023.pdf}}
%
This list consists of $\num{164}$ stars, the majority of which are Sun-like dwarfs: 66~F~dwarfs, 55~G~dwarfs, 40~K~dwarfs, and 3~M~dwarfs.
%
The target list is constructed assuming a maximum planet magnitude in the Cousins $R_c$ band of $31$ mag and a lower limit of \num{2.5e-11} for the planet-star flux ratio. 
% 
The adopted HZ limits are a semi-major axis of \qtyrange{0.95}{1.67}{\au} for a solar twin and planet sizes between \qtyrange{0.8}{1.4}{} Earth radii. 
%
For non-solar stars, the semi-major axis scales as the square root of the bolometric luminosity normalized to the Sun. 
%
This range of orbital separation corresponds to the \enquote{conservative habitable zone} \citep{kasting93, kopparapu13}. 
%
In the remainder of this work, we consider hypothetical Earth-sized planets orbiting at the right distance from their parent star to receive the same flux as the Earth receives from the Sun.
%
By design, all such planets should be observable by \HWO at quadrature phase.

\subsection{Accessible phase angles}
\label{subsec:2.2}

We first define the phase angle ranges over which the various phenomena---glint, Rayleigh peak, rainbow, and glory---manifest themselves in \cref{tab:phase_ranges}, also shown in \cref{fig:bottplot}. 
%
These ranges are all approximate, as the exact angles where these phenomena dominate depend on the details of the atmospheric and surface properties, as well as on the wavelengths being observed.

\begin{table}

    \begin{tabular}{ l c c c } 
        \toprule
        & $\alpha_\mathrm{min}$ & $\alpha_\mathrm{peak}$ & $\alpha_\mathrm{max}$ \\
        \midrule
        Glory       & \qty{0}{\degree}     & \qty{5}{\degree}     & \qty{10}{\degree} \\
        Rainbow    & \qty{22}{\degree}    & \qty{42}{\degree}    & \qty{63}{\degree} \\
        Rayleigh peak    & \qty{50}{\degree}    & \qty{70}{\degree}    & \qty{110}{\degree} \\
        Ocean Glint & \qty{130}{\degree}   & \qty{150}{\degree}   & \qty{170}{\degree} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A coronagraphic mask can obscure part of a planet's orbit. 
As illustrated in \cref{fig:annotated-orbit}, obscuration is a problem at small and large phase angles, when the planet is at small angular separation from its star.
The range of observable phase angles will depend on the \IWA of the coronagraph, as well as on the inclination and eccentricity of the exoplanet's orbit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Circular, edge-on orbits}

For the non-eccentric case, the minimum ($\alpha_\mathrm{min}$) and maximum ($\alpha_\mathrm{max}$) accessible phase angles are symmetric about \qty{90}{\degree}. 
We define the angle $\Delta \alpha$ such that: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Delta_phi}
    \Delta \alpha 
    = \alpha_\mathrm{max} - \alpha_\mathrm{min}
    =  2 \cdot (\alpha_\mathrm{max} - \qty{90}{\degree}) 
    =  2 \cdot (\qty{90}{\degree} - \alpha_\mathrm{min} )  \,.
\end{equation} 
The on-sky projected planet distance, $r_\mathrm{proj}$ (in \unit{\au}) is shown in \cref{fig:scattering-angle} for a non-eccentric case with a semi-major axis $a$ (in \unit{\au}), at a distance $d_*$ (in \unit{\parsec}) from the observer.
%
The scattering angle, $\varphi$, is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sinphi}
    \sin(\varphi) = - \sin(\alpha) = \frac{r_\mathrm{proj}}{a} \,,
\end{equation}
assuming small angles and $r_\mathrm{proj} = \delta d_*$, where $\delta$ is the on-sky angular separation.
%
We access the minimum phase angle when $r_\mathrm{proj}$ reaches the inner working angle separation, thus when $\delta = \mathrm{IWA}$. 
%
Combining \cref{eq:Delta_phi} and \cref{eq:sinphi}, we deduce:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:scattering_angle}
    \cos\left(\dfrac{\Delta \alpha}{2}\right) = \frac{\mathrm{IWA} 
    \cdot d_*}{a} \,.

As can be seen in \cref{fig:scatterplot}, for exoplanets in edge-on circular orbits, it will always be possible to observe the peak polarization due to Rayleigh scattering, which occurs around quadrature ($\alpha=\qty{90}{\degree}$), while the rainbow angle ($\alpha\sim\qty{40}{\degree}$) will only be accessible for a subset of exoplanets.

\subsubsection{Circular, inclined orbits}

Most planets are not in edge-on orbits as seen from Earth.
For an orbit with an inclination angle $i$ (where $i=\qty{0}{\degree}$ is face-on), we can identify the following two regimes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The coronagraph does not obscure any part of the sky-projected orbit: 
    the maximum phase angle coverage depends solely on $i$. 
        This holds for orbits that are relatively face-on (small $i$). 
    \item The coronagraph does obscure parts of the sky-projected orbit: the phase angle coverage depends only on the \IWA and the orbital semi-major axis $a$, following \cref{eq:scattering_angle}. 
\end{enumerate}

The range of accessible phase angles is then 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Delta_phi_max}
    \Delta \alpha = 
    \begin{cases}
        2 i & \textrm{for} \cos(i) > \frac{\mathrm{IWA} \cdot d_* }{a} \\ 
        2 \cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{\mathrm{IWA} \cdot d_* }{a}\right) & \textrm{for} \cos(i) < \frac{\mathrm{IWA} \cdot d_* }{a}
    \end{cases} \,
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Circular, randomly inclined orbits}
\label{sec:circular}

For each of the 164 stars on the \HWO target list, we generate \num{1000} random orbits of hypothetical habitable planets with semi-major axes that yield an Earth-equivalent-incident stellar flux. 
The orbital inclination angles $i$ are randomly drawn from a distribution that is uniform in $\cos i$. 
We then use \cref{eq:Delta_phi_max} to determine the range of accessible phase angles for each hypothetical planet.
The solid lines in \cref{fig:betaallofit} show the cumulative distribution of the maximum and minimum accessible phase angles normalised to the total number of systems in the \HWO target list for different values of the \IWA.

\subsubsection{Eccentric, randomly inclined orbits}
\label{sec:eccentric}

We repeat the Monte Carlo simulations from \cref{sec:circular}, assuming the orbital eccentricity follows a beta-distribution with shape parameters $a=0.867$ and $b=3.03$ \citep{2013MNRAS.434L..51K}. 
%
We randomly draw \num{1000} orbits for each star and determine the sky-projected orbits following, for example, \citet{2010exop.book...15M}. 
%
Orbital eccentricities are drawn from the beta distribution, and inclination angles are uniform in $\cos i$. 
%
\Cref{fig:ball-o-yarn} shows a sample of the generated orbits.

We then calculate the minimum and maximum accessible phase angles for \IWA{}s of $\qtylist{21; 41; 62; 83}{\mas}$.
%
The dashed lines in \cref{fig:betaallofit} show the normalised cumulative distribution of the accessible phase angles for each value of the \IWA for eccentric orbits. 
%
We also calculate which target planets would be observable at the phase angles where ocean glint, the rainbow, or the Rayleigh peak occur.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Simulating contrast curves}
\label{subsec:2.4}

A second parameter that is crucial for detecting angular features like rainbows and ocean glint on Earth-like exoplanets is the contrast, that is, the planet/star flux ratio. 
%
While contrast is not the main focus of this paper, we note that the total and polarized flux contrasts depend on the phase angle, due to a combination of the changing illumination fraction of the observable planetary disk and non-isotropic reflection by the planet.
%
For the contrast calculations, we start with the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program’s Mission Star List for \HWO, which includes for every star an estimated contrast for an Earth-twin in the habitable zone.
%
The contrast is given by \citep[e.g.,][]{2023A&A...671A.165M}
\begin{equation}
    C(\alpha) 
    = F_p(\alpha) / F_* 
    = A_\mathrm{G} \cdot \phi(\alpha) \cdot \left( R_p / a(\alpha) \right)^2 \,,
    \label{eq:contrast}
\end{equation}
where $A_\mathrm{G}$ is the planet's geometric albedo, $R_p$ its radius, $\phi(\alpha)$ is the phase function at phase angle $\alpha$ (normalized to \num{1.0} at full phase, thus at $\alpha=\qty{0}{\degree}$), and $a$ is the distance between the planet and its host star.
%
The contrast estimations for \HWO assumed circular orbits and a Lambertian phase function  \citep{Russell1916} with $A_\mathrm{G}=0.2$. 
%
For a more accurate representation of the contrast as a function of separation, we can update the phase function with the models shown in Fig. \Cref{fig:bottplot} from \citet{treesandstam2019}. 
%
To update the phase function, we will first correct for the reflected flux at quadrature and then map the normalised total flux and polarized flux as a function of separation.

%
We assume that the calculated contrasts in the Star List for \HWO correspond to the reflected flux at quadrature and use \cref{eq:contrast} to calculate the reflected light fraction at $\alpha=\qty{90}{\degree}$ as $C(90) = \qty{6.37}{\percent}$. 
%
In addition, we calculate the reflected light fraction at quadrature with the updated model of \citet{treesandstam2019}, which assumes an Earth-like planet with an ocean surface, a wind-speed of $\qty{7}{\meter\per\second}$, and patchy liquid water clouds, observed at $\qty{670}{\nano\meter}$.
%
We correct the star list contrast by dividing by the \qty{6.37}{\percent} reflected light fraction of the Lambertian phase function and multiplying by the reflected light fraction of the updated model. 
%
We map the orbital phase for circular orbits to the phase angle and on-sky separation, given an inclination $i$ of \qty{90}{\degree}. 
%
Together, they give the reflected light contrast as a function of separation for a full orbit.
%
We multiply this flux with the degree of polarization to obtain the polarized contrast.
%
\Cref{fig:contrasts} shows the resulting contrast curves for three of the closest target stars: the M~dwarf Lalande~21185, the K~dwarf $\epsilon$~Eri, and the G~dwarf $\alpha$~Cen~A.
%
These calculations are by no means complete or exact, given the many variables that go into the modelling of reflected total and polarized fluxes of Earth-like exoplanets \citep{treesandstam2019,trees2022}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The effect of eccentricity}
\label{sec:result_eccentricity}

As shown in \cref{fig:betaallofit}, a realistic eccentricity distribution increases the number of systems that can be observed at each phase angle (notably for the red and purple lines). 
%
This is because eccentric planets spend more time at orbital separations greater than their semi-major axis, and hence are more likely to peek out from behind the coronagraph \IWA and extreme orbital phases (albeit with worse contrast due to the greater star-planet separation).
%
The eccentricity does not significantly affect the number of systems for \IWA smaller than that used in the selection of the \HWO target list (yellow and blue lines). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Accessible scattering phenomena}
%\label{sec:results_scattering_phenomena}

\Cref{fig:accessible_phase_angles} and Table \ref{tab:nstars_detect} show the number of systems in which key scattering phenomena will be observable for different \IWA.
%
The Rayleigh peak, which can be used to determine if a planet has an atmosphere, appears near quadrature and is therefore observable in the most systems.
The rainbow feature appears further from quadrature (around $\alpha=\qty{40}{\degree}$), but will still be observable in a significant fraction of systems.
%
The position and shape of the rainbow peak is sensitive to the properties of the cloud droplets, allowing their characterization if the peak of the rainbow feature can be reached.
%
In most systems, only the first half of the glint feature would be observable, but this can still be used to identify a liquid ocean on the surface of a planet, a key indicator of habitability.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Contrast curves}
\label{sec:results_contrast}

The contrast of the planet is also an important factor in assessing the detectability of these scattering phenomena. 
%
\Cref{fig:contrasts} shows approximate contrast curves for three of the stars in the \HWO target list, assuming an Earth-like planet on an edge-on orbit.
%
The overall contrast varies significantly for each system and throughout the orbit. In general, planets orbiting high-mass stars tend to offer larger angular separation but lower contrast ratios. 
%
The observability of these planets will depend on the starlight suppression of the coronagraph, which is influenced by its \IWA.
%
It will be important to consider both the accessible phase angles and contrast limits when deciding on the \IWA of the \HWO coronagraph if these scattering features are to be observed.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Habitable Worlds Observatory is a coronagraphic space telescope envisioned to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets in the 2040s. 
%
The instrument design and capabilities are still under development and should be driven by the mission's science goals.
%
In this work, we investigated the possibility of using \HWO to detect optical phenomena with specific angular features in polarized and unpolarized reflected light, such as rainbows, ocean glint, and glory, which could establish a planet's habitability. 
%
We primarily focused on the range of accessible phase angles given the limitations of the coronagraphic \IWA and aimed to investigate which phenomena could potentially be observed.
%
While we do not consider the detect-ability of the scattering features beyond their accessibility, we show they are typically more distinct in polarised light but the exoplanet-star contrast ratio is lower than the unpolarised light contrast ratio.
%
A benefit of observing the polarized reflected light is that a coronagraph is not explicitly required for quiescent stars, as the light of these stars themselves can be considered to be unpolarized \citep{kemp1987}.

The desire to detect and characterize a large number of Earth-like exoplanets, and the intrinsic occurrence of such planets around different stellar spectral types, will drive the choice of coronagraphic \IWA for \HWO. 
%
Assuming a \qty{62}{\mas} \IWA, $\sim\qty{76}{\percent}$ of planetary systems in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's Mission Star List for \HWO would be observable at phases angles with maximal polarization from Rayleigh scattering.
%
The rainbow of light that is scattered in droplets of water clouds and ocean glint, both of which indicate the presence of a water cycle which provides additional context to the habitability of an exoplanet, would be accessible in $\sim\qty{28}{\percent}$ and $\sim\qty{10}{\percent}$ of systems respectively.
%
The presence of a water cycle on Earth-like exoplanets in the remaining systems would have to be established through less direct methods: spectropolarimetry or rotational mapping.
%
To observe more scattering features in more systems, \HWO' would need to have a smaller \IWA by use of smaller coronagraph and potentially a larger primary mirror.
